# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Overview
In this lab, you will create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. You will also create connections between the instances.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
	
	- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
	
	- Connect between the two instances.

## Steps:

1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http
	
	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http
	
	
2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
	
	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"
	
	
3. Connect between the two instances.

	1.	Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
	
		- Connect to my-vm-2:
			
			gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
			
		- Ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
		
			ping -c 4 my-vm-1
			
		- Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
		
			ssh my-vm-1
			
		- At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
		
			sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
		
		- Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
			
			sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
			
		- 	Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
		
			Hi from tokunbo
			
		-	Exit the nano text editor. Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		
			curl http://localhost/
			
		  - Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
				
		- To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		
			exit
			
		- To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
		
			curl http://my-vm-1/
			
		  - Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
		  
	2.	Get the external IP of my-vm-1 instance from the following command:
	
			gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a
			
	3.	Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. Hit enter.
	
		 - Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
